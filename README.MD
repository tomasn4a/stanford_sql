This respositoty contains my solutions to the exercises for the Stanford Online SQL course.

Please note that this are not in any way the official solutions and that maybe some of them are not even the correct solutions, but just happen to extract the correct information from the examples database by chance. Some of them might offer a correct solution but expressed in a non-elegant convoluted way. I appreciate and encourage comments on how to improve this solutions. 

These solutions were checked against the course's autograder and all were marked as correct. The autograder expects SQL constructs supported by SQLite.
